**Description:** search engine containing almost all the data from the lastest Pokémon game on Nintendo DS.

**Innovations:** Invent a simple, intuitive and tiny but complete search system; other Pokedex use several textboxes, checkboxes and dropdown menus to make a complex search: I use 1 single textbar.

**Challenges:** Gathering all the data automatically (more than 45000 entries), being able to mix several search criteria into a single textbox, create a system that allows you to share your search (even the most complex ones).
