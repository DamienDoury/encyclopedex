*Online Intuitive search engine (Pokedex). Check it out at http://encyclopedex.com!*

*Started March 2013*


**Description:** search engine containing almost all the data from the lastest Pokémon game on Nintendo DS.

**Innovations:** Invent a simple, intuitive and tiny but complete search system; add tricks with the mouse and the keyboard to use it easily.

**Challenges:** Gathering all the data automatically (more than 45000 entries), being able to mix several search criteria into a single textbox, create a system that allows you to share your search (even the most complex ones).
